There are two folders - ParkingGarage and NativeCodeChallenge. Both folders contain respective solutions
NativeCodeChallenge -
DataAccess1 Folder - DataAccess project. Here EntityFramework is used as I personally prefer ORM than ADO .net
DataAccessTest - Tests for Repository
NativeCodeChallenge - This is console application doing three things
	-Sum of even numbers
	-Sending http request and Logging request in db
	-Printing array of numbers  in two threads
	-Main method does it. Also there is unit test project
NativeCodeChallengeTest - unit tests for NativeCodeChallenge

ae_code_challenge Folder - It is db project which contains script for table, stored procedure and index

ChallengeWebApplication Folder- This project started with Empty web project.
Rest API Get can be accessed by localhost:2610/api/Values which gives current date
localhost:2610/api/Values/get/abc gives timeout

The UI which shows no of requests in each status per hour (for just today) can be accessed by localhost:2610/home/
Controller name is HomeController.
The UI is very basic as this is prototype

NUnitTestProject2 Folder- unit tests for ChallengeWebApplication 

WishList - here I haven't used Dependency Injection or Any Mocking framework (I personally like FakeItEasy) for unit tests because of time constraint.
